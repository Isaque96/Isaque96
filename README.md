Isaque96 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its where I put some of my projects when I begin to learn anything.
Now I'm looking for a start at the developer career, some oportunity for me to learn and collaborate with my teammates to make something bigger then us!
Working with a team will be awesome for me to grow faster and learn, also good to see a big project comming alive!
